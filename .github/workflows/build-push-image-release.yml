# This workflow build and push test images to https://quay.io/repository/opendatahub/distributed-workloads-tests

# Create GitHub action which will run test image build (implemented in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHOAIENG-18525)
# and push built image into https://quay.io/repository/opendatahub/distributed-workloads-tests

# This action will be triggered for any code change in tests folder or in go.mod or go.sum. It should be possible 
# to trigger the action also manually.

# From opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads it will push image tag "latest". From red-hat-data-services/distributed-workloads 
# it will push image tag corresponding to the release which the branch targets (i.e. "2.17").
